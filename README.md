# Dynamics and directionality
We analyze the influence of the directionality of the graph over the dynamics that occurrs on top of it. We are currently considering three types of dynamics: random walk, simplified integrate-and-fire, and the SIS epidemic model.

There are two main files:
 * dynamics.py
 * analyze.py

The execution of dynamics.py requires a configuration file, in json format.

The results can be analyzed using the analyze.py script.
